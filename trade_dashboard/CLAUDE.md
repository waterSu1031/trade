# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a trade dashboard project repository that is currently empty. The project structure and build commands will be defined as the codebase is developed.

## Development Setup

Since this is a new repository, the development setup will depend on the technology stack chosen:

- For a React/TypeScript dashboard: `npm install` and `npm run dev`
- For a Python dashboard: `pip install -r requirements.txt` and appropriate run commands
- For other frameworks: Setup commands will be documented here as the project evolves

## Common Commands

Build commands, test commands, and linting will be documented here once the project technology stack is established.

## Architecture Notes

The trade dashboard architecture will be documented here as the project structure is defined, including:

- Data flow patterns for trade data
- Component organization for dashboard widgets
- State management approach
- API integration patterns for trading data sources
